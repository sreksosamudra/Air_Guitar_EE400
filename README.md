# Air Musician EE400
Explore the repository for the EE400 (TinyML) final projectâ€”an innovative air guitar system. This project harnesses gesture motion detected by flex sensors and accelerometers, enabling users to experience the magic of playing an air guitar like never before.

## How to Use
The repository contains the codes required from data collection to model deployment. However, the model training part is done through [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/), a platform that simplifies the process of developing machine learning models for edge devices. Following the steps below will guide you through the process of data collection, model training, and deployment.
